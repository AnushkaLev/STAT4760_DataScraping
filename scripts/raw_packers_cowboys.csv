ngsbc3z,PomegranateFun4535,"My personal take but if a game goes into overtime, neither team actually deserves to win. If you lose in overtime, oh well. If you win in overtime, then you got lucky. I don’t have an issue with ties especially since we have never had more than two in a season since overtime was introduced for regular season games 

But I remember two instances in the last decade where a tie actually played a role in playoff eligibility going into the last week of the season. They are as follows:

2018 (week one) - Steelers 21, Browns 21. Pittsburgh finished 9-6-1 and were fighting for the sixth seed as the final Sunday Night game was Colts vs Titans, both 9-6. Winner would make the playoffs. But if that would end in a tie, then the Steelers would be in instead. Meanwhile, had the Browns won the opener, they would’ve been 8-7 going into the last week and facing the 9-6 Ravens for a chance to win the division 

2021 - one wild card spot was already determined (Patriots, 10-7) and the Chargers and Raiders (both 9-7) faced off against each other for the “final” wild card spot. If they tied, then both teams would make it into the playoffs. If not, then the winner, along with the 9-7-1 Steelers, would be in. Had the Steelers beaten the Lions, they would’ve already clinched a spot before kickoff. Had they lost to the Lions, they would’ve already been eliminated from playoff contention and the AFC playoff field would’ve already been set, leading to probably a different game for Sunday Night. As we know, that game was SO CLOSE to ending in a tie 

In short, with the relative infrequency of ties, the relatively few games played in a season compared to other major sports and the additional wrinkles they can add to playoff contention, we should keep ties. It makes the totality of the season more interesting ",2,1759127255.0,1,t1_ngrw9ta

Yes, except if the team first in possession commits a safety or if the clock runs out.

Look at all the international games in Europe and *Latin America*. Not only that but a good chunk of people residing in this country are Latino and likely listen to Bad Bunny. The audience you mentioned is watching the Super Bowl either way, no matter who performs the halftime show. But now you have an artist that can bring in not only a whole other group that resides in the US, but may that reside in the Western Hemisphere. This isn’t going to blow up in their face.

**Bad Bunny is undeniably a global superstar**, and there are multiple compelling arguments—based on music, culture, business, and influence—that support this status:

1. **Global Chart Success** – He topped Spotify’s global charts for three consecutive years and had the most-streamed album worldwide in 2022 (*Un Verano Sin Ti*).
2. **Massive Touring Power** – His stadium tours sold out across the Americas and Europe, making him the highest-grossing touring artist in the world in 2022.
3. **Cross-Language Dominance** – Despite singing almost entirely in Spanish, he consistently tops charts and headlines festivals in English-speaking markets.
4. **Cultural Impact** – He’s a fashion trailblazer, gender norm challenger, and political voice, with influence that extends beyond music.
5. **Digital &amp; Social Reach** – With billions of views and massive engagement across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, his global fanbase is vast and active.
6. **Major Brand Collaborations** – He’s partnered with global companies like Adidas, Crocs, and Gucci, further cementing his international appeal.
