Assuming that doing a 2 pt after the first TD or after the second TD have the same chance of working (~50%), doing it earlier allows you to answer the question “do I need 1 more possession or 2 more possessions?”


So in this case, they went for an onside kick. Whereas if you don’t get the 2 point conversion with like 20 seconds, you’re probably screwed regardless. One counter-argument is that having a one possession game increases the pressure and going for 2 to tie the game especially puts more pressure on the defense",7,1764370403.0,0,t3_1p931uu

* Maye, Allen, Tua

* Rodgers, Jackson, Burrow

* TLaw, Stroud

* Mahomes, Herbert

* Hurts, Dak, Daniels, Jones (look at how much better he is with competent coaching in Indiana)

* Love, Goff, Darnold and yes, Caleb too. Just look at the night and day diffrence between seasons for him

* Mayfield, Cousins

* Stafford, Purdy, Geno

* Non starters: Joe ""Elite Dragon"" Flacco &amp; McCorkle (just look at him on the 9ers)

nravkoh,snakefriend6,"Oh I know, in fact, often the more severe cases of post-concussion syndrome originate from contra-coup concussion forces - not the actual initial blow to the head itself, but the snapping back of the head to its normal/resting position afterwards. And sub-concussive blows — which don’t look like much at all to the observer, and don’t feel / seem like much at the time they occur, either! — are believed to be most responsible / dangerous as far as leading to CTE later in life. But, of course, a sub-concussive blow (by definition) wouldn’t result in immediate exhibition of concussion-like symptoms.  He looked dazed right after that play, which is unusual considering no clear impact occurred to his head, even minor, during that play. I think it’s probably that he suffered a head impact earlier in the play, maybe a play or two prior, and the symptoms were just a bit delayed. A lag in symptom presentation is not uncommon. Either that or the (even scarier) second impact syndrome, where an even very minor, otherwise insignificant force to the head combined with / on top of a recent or preexisting concussion to result in severe symptoms, brain swelling, and in some cases, (if untreated), even death.",1,1764375297.0,5,t1_nralog5

That would only lead to the conclusion that Kellen Moore is the best passing game coordinator ever which I can assure you he isn’t or that Jalen’s limitations are influencing the scheme.

Some of the more dynastic teams like the Chiefs hire failed HCs as coaches. You can have a successful year and win the Super Bowl and they’re less likely to get poached, because they had their shot and didn’t take it. 

I would love for us to get Daboll or someone similar as OC.

My point is that perhaps his first season playing truly badly, and not even all the time, with the worst OC we've had in recent memory, doesn't all of a sudden vindicate people who have somehow found a way to believe the man has been carried every other season.

There's no logic to it. He's done it in heavy passing attacks. He's done it with middling run game. He's done it under pressure. He's done it with JAG receivers when he needed to. He's done it with his legs.
