If it was an inside route, he would have to flip at 180 and then try to gain ground on the much faster WR. It was bad technique by Surtain. If he is that much slower than the WR, then he has to be more physical at the line WITH INSIDE LEVERAGE, or he needs to back up about 5 yards and give the WR space. If the WR cuts inside for a short route, you slam down on it. If he goes deep, you can stay in a back pedal to react. In which case, he could have blanketed the WR. Just awful form, and Romo should know that. Stop glazing when good players mess up",2,1768689400.0,0,t3_1qfnyfb

1) I don't think the Broncos are a great team (don't think there are any great teams this year), but as a Pats fan, I don't see any path to the Super Bowl that involves beating Denver. Houston would have a much better shot at Mile High than New England.  

2) I think if Josh Allen starts off with like 39 yards rushing and a touchdown on the first drive, the Bills are kinda in trouble. They are so depleted, absolutely, but asking him, the best player still standing, to do four quarters of magic might be too much.

3) The Saturday divisional round, 4 PM is where my favorite underrated upset in football history took place (quick Bronco trigger warning), Jacksonville winning in Mile High in January 1997. I, an 11 year old had no idea that was possible. The Broncos immediately won back to back Super Bowls. They in all honesty could have won three. An incredible shock.",7,1768683892.0,0,t3_1qfnyfb

They also ran Kelce on a clearing route. Basically you wanted to keep your eyes on Mahomes and Kelce. The Bills, though, run a lot of picks and pound the ball. When they motioned Hardman inside, it made the defense have to account for the run even more. It you watch Surtain, he's legit just staring into the backfield because he is expecting a run. So, again, same concept but completely different functionality. Because even with Surtain pointing, he is pointing to tell someone on the other side to account for Hardman if Hardman motions all the way over.

That's just reality. If an AFC championship means a lot more by having to go through Mahomes and Burrow/Lamar (it does), then *not having to* go through the best quarterbacks makes it mean a lot less. Period. This is true for all sports. The path to get the ring determines how that championship run is perceived. 


With that said, as a Chiefs fan, I am pulling for Josh to get a ring or SB appearance this year, both out of pity and because he deserves it. But even he would tell you (behind closed doors) that he has to beat Mahomes in the playoffs at some point. ",-24,1768689649.0,0,t3_1qfnyfb

I wish that Josh Allen would own me. I would be lying on his bed, waiting for Josh Allen to come home, and I smile as I hear the bedroom door open and see him. “You were amazing tonight, Joshy,” I say to him. “You’re amazing every night!” “Oh, but sweetheart, you say that to me after every game!” Josh Allen says with a smile. He looks tired, but I can’t help but grin widely as he sits next to me on the bed. He puts his hand on my cheek: it’s cold from the cruel Buffalo nights. I shiver, and Josh Allen lifts his hand away. “Too cold?” he says to me. “I like it,” I say back, and gently rest my head in his lap. Josh Allen gently plays with my hair as I snuggle deep into his warm lap, almost purring. “Joshy?” I say. “Would you like me to please you tonight?” “You don’t have to, sweetheart,” he says to me. “But I want to, Joshy!” I say. I bite my lip, and Josh Allen smiles at me. “If you want to, cutie,” he says, and I feel his member slowly grow under his shorts. I pull it out, it’s beautiful and almost Nick Foles-sized in length and girth. I wrap my mouth around it, just the way that Josh Allen likes it. I provide him with oral pleasure, and before too long, he grabs on to my hair tighter, like he always does when he is about to release. I look up at Josh Allen and say “Joshy? Could you cum in my mouth, pretty please?” Josh Allen smiles and nods. I please him some more, and he finishes in my mouth, and I happily swallow Josh Allen’s thick, copious cum. “Was that good, Joshy?” I ask him. But he doesn’t respond.

I look up. He is looking out the window. The sound of men and women jumping through tables echoes in the night. He turns to look at me with a soft smile. “Of course it was good, sweetheart.” I nuzzle against him and feel his chest rise and fall, and I know that I am Josh Allen’s little toy and that Josh Allen will always care for me.",-3,1768687426.0,0,t3_1qfnyfb
